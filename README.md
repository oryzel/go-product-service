# go-product-service

## Description
This is an example of implementation of Simple RESTful using clean architecture (Golang) projects.

### How To Run This Project
> Make Sure you already install golang in your machine,
if you don't have golang in your machine you can install through this link https://golang.org/doc/install

##### Check golang already installed on youd machine
```bash
$ go version
go version go1.13 windows/amd64
```

>  Make Sure you already install mysql in your machine, after mysql installed and running. 
Run the product.sql in your mysql.

Since the project already use Go Module, I recommend to put the source code in any folder but GOPATH.

##### Check gopath directory
```bash
$ go env GOPATH
C:\Users\Sabriyan\go
```
